Description: The core of the shinystan package is the ShinyStan graphical user 
  interface, which provides interactive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) diagnostics 
  and plots and tables helpful for analyzing a posterior sample. ShinyStan
  is powered by RStudio's Shiny web application framework and works with the 
  output of MCMC programs written in any programming language (and has extended 
  functionality for models fit using the rstan package and the No-U-Turn sampler). 
  A function is also provided that helps users deploy ShinyStan apps for their 
  models using RStudio's ShinyApps service (this feature requires installing the 
  suggested 'shinyapps' package available at the URL in Additional_repositories). 
  Each deployed ShinyStan app has a unique URL and is compatible with Safari, 
  Firefox, Chrome, and most other browsers.
