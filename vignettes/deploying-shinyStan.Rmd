### About

Create an app hosted on RStudio's ShinyApps service (shinyapps.io) for each of your models. 

Note: R users who don't use RStudio's IDE can still deploy shinyStan apps to shinyapps.io. 

### Step 1: ShinyApps account

**Signup**

To deploy your app to RStudio's shinyapps.io you will need a ShinyApps account. If you don't already have one you can sign up at http://www.shinyapps.io/. 

**Setup**

After signing up for a ShinyApps account, follow the instruction for setting up your account on your local system using the `setAccountInfo` function in the `shinyapps` package.  


### Step 2: Download `shinystan_for_shinyapps` library

Download the `shinystan_for_shinyapps` library. 


### Step 3: Use `deploy_shinystan` to deploy your app to shinyapps.io

The `deploy_shinystan` function will deploy a shinyStan app unique to your model to RStudio's ShinyApps service.

For this example assume that 

- `sso` is the `shinystan` object you want to use
- the username for your ShinyApps account (from Step 1) is `username`
- the path to the `shinystan_for_shinyapps` library (from Step 2) is `Desktop/shinystan_for_shinyapps`
- the name you want to use for the app is `MyModel`. 

You can deploy the app with the commands

```
deploy_shinystan(sso, appDir = "Desktop/shinystan_for_shinyapps", appName = "MyModel", account = "username")
```

If you have a vector of observations `y` that you want to use for shinyStan's graphical posterior predictive checks then you can also specify the `ppcheck_data` argument

```
deploy_shinystan(sso, ppcheck_data = y, appDir = "Desktop/shinystan_for_shinyapps", appName = "MyModel", account = "username")
```

After the deployment process has finished your app should be located at https://username.shinyapps.io/appName, where username and appName are your ShinyApps username and the name for your app. You can also view your app by going to http://www.shinyapps.io and logging into your account.

The only limit to the number of shinyStan apps you can deploy is the limit set by RStudio [your type of ShinyApps account](https://www.shinyapps.io/#pricing).
